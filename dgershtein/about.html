</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The School:</span> University of Waterloo

<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Degree in Pursuit:</span> Bachelor of Computer Science with a minor in fine arts
</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Dream:</span> To one day eventually pursue a career, in fields such as 3D computer graphics 
or animation, requiring the combination of skills I will have acquired in both the technical 
and artistic fields. 
</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Reasons: </span>In essence, animation gives life to just about any inanimate object. An 
animated film contains the same degree of storytelling and emotion as a regular film with 
people. The different animation styles, the character development, and the technical skill 
required to produce such a film is truly humbling. With this in mind, what started out as a 
purely math/computer science degree eventually had the artistic component added to it. 
Extensive knowledge of the mechanisms behind animation is provided by the Computer 
Science component, whereas the imagination and artistic techniques from the Fine Art 
component.
</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Past:</span> Ever since I can remember myself, I've had an arts utensil of sorts in hand, 
whether it was a paintbrush, a sketching pencil, an airbrush, and in later years, even a 
computer with animation-powerful software. Visual arts have always been a part of my 
life.  I was fortunate enough to have constant encouragement from family and friends to 
continue, and so it has become a necessary part of reality. 
</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Present:</span> This love for visual arts developed into a love for animation when I was 
exposed to computer science, and so what better idea than to combine the two fields!  
</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Pursuit:</span> 
I realize this dream cannot be achieved overnight, so I've been trying to overcome initial 
setbacks, such as not being in Waterloo's co-op program as learning experiences, 
and modelling my school schedule after that of a co-op student, by alternating 
between work terms and school terms. 
I spent one summer at a Montreal company, <a href="www.jonar.com"> Jonar </a>, where I re-designed 
all the graphic components of the company's marketing aspects. Anything from 
business cards to the company's website. Yes, I did say business cards – solid 
babysteps is the way to go. Or at least it proved to be, since the company owner 
later asked me to produce an animated short <link> What is ERP? </link> to explain 
one of the main software solutions provided by Jonar. The short has reached over 100,000 views in well under a year post-production, and as a result I was asked to create a sequel, <link> What is EDI? </link> process of creating a second animated short, to explain the company’s other main
software solution. So there. Take the babysteps and agree to design those business
cards, and you get to experiment with animation for the greater part of the term :)
The following work term was spent at IBM in Ottawa. Admittedly this was a change of 
content compared to animated shortsdone at Jonar, and the 
reasoning for the decision being that I wanted to learn more about the backbone of 
computer science, before continuing with the, what some might call, the “artistic 
cover”. 
My next work term was spent at a startup in Ottawa - <a href="www.cranksoftware.com">Crank Software</a> where I was working on image processing tools and PSD importing for Crank's Storyboard Suite. I got to know PSD files inside out after having written a parser for it. Never want to do that again. 
</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Side-Project:</span> The Side studio began as a project to make an online photo gallery for my dad, but quickly turned into a combined portfolio website. Admittedly, it is heavily focused on visual arts and web development/design, but an entirely new section is on its way, which will display code I've written. Until then though, feel free to inquire for samples.
</p></div>
<div class="section"><p>
<span class="heading">The Future:</span> As I've mentioned many many times on this page, I hope to accomplish The Dream. Until then, I plan on taking the most out of every situation, good or bad, in order to further develop my own style of bringing inanimate objects to life, as well as developing a clear-cut extensive knowledge of the computer science backbone.
