					<h2> Carnivale Lune Bleue </h2>
					<p>
					The full Carnivale Lune Bleue set modeled, textured, lighted, and rendered in Maya, and eventually composited in Adobe After Effects. I'm still currently working on this project (and it's due in a few days to I better get on it!) while on exchange in Australia. This is a carnival I worked at for two summers a few years back and I really wanted to recreate the scene in 3D.

					<h2> Hotel Transylvannia </h2>
					<p>
						This is a project I'm currently working on for my 3D Animation class at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, during my exchange in Australia. The task was to choose a scene from an animated film, model it, and render out a quick fly-through of the set. I chose to do Hotel Transylvannia (God knows why) and am now sitting in the lab waiting for the render to finish (it's been 6 days). For now I have posted an in-production video, and will post the rest of the images and project documentation once it's done!

					<h2>C++ Ray Tracer</h2>
					<p>This was my final project for my Computer Graphics course at the Univerity of Waterloo. It was a bit of a nightmare to make considering we only had two weeks to code our projects. After just a few (7) sleepless nights, and a couple cups of Timmy's coffees (~40), the project was done and received an Honorable Mention, as well as an over 100% grade. <br><br> <a style="color:#119AE2" href="report.html">(View Online Documentation)</a>

					<h2>Storyboard Differencer</h2>
					<p>My last work term I spent at an Ottawa-based startup - Crank Software - where I spent most of my time working on a merging tool that differences and merges two Storyboard models. My goal was to automate as much of the differencing as possible, and let the user visually select which differences or updates they would like to bring over from one model to the other. The most difficult part was trying to figure out a good balance between which procedures should be automated and which should be up to the user to decide. Considering this was a whole new area of the Storyboard Suite, it was fun to get a whole project running from scratch.

					<h2>Image Splitter</h2>
					<p>One of the tools I had to implement for Crank Software during my last work term. Got to know PSD files up close and personal when I had to write a PSD file parser. Never want to do that again. Had a fun time coming up with an efficient algorithm to slice the image to strip away as many transparent pixels as possible. Check out the blog to see how it works!

					<h2> The Side Studio </h2>
					<p>
					Initially started out as a photogallery that I created for my father's photography, and then expanded it to be a family "side project" which displays both my father's gallery and my personal online portoflio. I have just re-coded my whole side of the site, and will then get to updating my father's photos. The name SIDE studio came from putting together my family members' initials.

					This was my first work experience as a web developer. I was hired to design and then develop the ompany's website from scratch, including redesigning all of the company's branding. I then spent the rest of the semester creating a cartoon educational video that described the company's main product <a href="animations.html#erp">What is ERP?</a>

						<strong>Pop:</strong>removes and returns the last stop.</br>
						<strong>Shift:</strong>removes and returns the first stop.</br>
						<strong>Reverse:</strong> Reverse the order of all stops.</br>
						<strong>Sort:</strong> Sorts the stops. </br>
						<strong>Map:</strong>Modifies the gradient by calling the callback for every stop.</br>

					<h2> Daily Financial Tracker </h2>

					This was a quick prototype of a financial tracker application that I created for a UI challenge about a year ago. You can select categories and add items to them, then add expenses to each items. As you add expenses, the bar of each category sinks and changes colour accordingly.

					<h2> Maze </h2>
					<p>
					A quick Maze path-finding algorithm I wrote while procrastinating studing for exams a few terms ago. As the user clicks on the tiles, an Adjacency matrix is created. Once the bottom-lefct corner is selected, a depth-first search algorithm is applied to the adjacency matrix and the maze is solved. Begin building the maze by selecting any of the outer tiles (other than the bottom right corener) and once you click on the bottom right corner, the shortest-distance finder will execute and solve the maze.
